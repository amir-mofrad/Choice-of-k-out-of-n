# Choice-of-k-out-of-n

This code is used to permutate different configuraitons of an existing file. 
Often times in atomistic simulations one needs to consider the energetics or other
proprties of a certain material as a funciton of distribution of atoms within the structure.

The code reads an original file in XYZ file and asks the number of choices.
Lastly, it will ask whether or not those choices to be concatenated to another
file or not. 

# Good Luck!
